### FAQ

**What are you working on right now?**

I just wrote and released [Retrofit](http://retrofit.venportman.com). My big challenge right now is transitioning myself 100% into the Ven Portman name for my digital self.

**Where do you live?**

I live near Fruitvale Station in Oakland, California. I live in a four-bedroom hacker house with chickens out back. It's unclear whether we need to give the chickens feed, or if they will survive on falling pears from the pear tree.

**Who do you live with?**

I live with a Unix wizard, a Node.js magician, and a rowdy Mexican bandit.

**Tell me about a day in your life**

I wake up. I make coffee in a steel espresso pot. I start up my machine to a bare Arch Linux prompt. I login and type 'startx'. I bang on the keyboard for a bit. Then I put my shoes on and get a mexican pastry 'con crema'. Later I eat a carne asada super burrito. Then I drink myself to sleep with MGDs.

**Are you a real person?**

Yes, no. Do you believe the Internet is real, or a figment of your imagination?

I had this idea a few years ago. What if I had a pseudononymous second self (or avatar) who would take care of my physical self? In early 2012 I was living in San Francisco, and I made up the name Ven Portman. I used the name at a laundry service once, and ever since the name stuck. Now it's fall of 2013, and I'm transitioning into the namespace for all of my digital presence.

**Why Ven Portman?**

The name popped into my head in the beginning of 2012. It kind of stuck. I wanted a name that sound international without being specific to any country. Also, there's no search pollution to the name besides Natalie Portman. And she is good company.
