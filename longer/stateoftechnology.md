### State of Technology 

A client keeps asking me if no one uses the Internet anymore. Is the web dead?

My answer is: maybe...?

We all remember the social age. When everyone swarmed the Internet with profiles, and avatars, and presences. We're asked to remember this as the golden age, by the companies who created this era. Mobile phones had just been invented. This led to a new way of thinking about digital presences.

But now we're in this horrible technological slump. It's a terrible feeling to look at the Macbook Pro you spent $1600 on two years ago and have to admit to yourself "this doesn't do anything." It can lead to a certain level of resentment towards technology. "I invested in this shit, and now look at how useless it is."

Technology isn't useless. Your Macbook Pro is.

This is why I ditched mine. It was useless.

The good news is, technology is still interesting. The bad news is, all of the cool stuff is happening deeper in the stack. And (probably) on a different platform than the one you're using.

As far as I can tell, we're in an optimization phase at the intersection of humans, computers, and the Internet. We've seen what the Internet is capable of, but we know we built it all wrong in so many ways.

If you've ever used a tiling window manager, you know what I'm talking about.

Almost no one has heard of a tiling window manager. But switching to one can boost your productivity as far as an estimated 80%.

With a tiling window manager, you know you're done. Because when you're done, you shut the window and your next window fills the rest of the screen. Once you're done with this window, you close it. Once you've closed all of your windows, you're left with no windows. This is best, because you know you're done. Now you can go drink yourself to sleep, Linux wizard, for you deserve it.

The confusing thing about a few years ago was all of the interesting things in technology were happening in the consumer-release cycle. Now consumers are so burned out by technology it's hard to get them to even care about what is happening inside your machine. We're dissenfranchised from the Internet, and the computers connecting it, because we aren't sure what its useful for. Again. Except for getting spammed on social networks, and for routing all of our personal information to the NSA.

Meanwhile all of this fun stuff is happening deeper into the space. It's interesting because it's an optimization. It's some very interesting projects, built in the right way, the way of quality, by people who care about this stuff.

Just look at systemd. I will be trolled from now until the next century by saying this, but I believe Systemd is one of the key factors in making Linux stable enough to bring it to almost anyone. Systemd also put a whole bunch of sysadmins who dicked around with init shell scripts all day out of a job. But just think about it, when I want to control the software running on the lower levels of my computer all I need to know is a few simple commands

	$ systemctl start program
	$ systemctl enable program
	$ systemctl stop program
	$ systemctl disable program

Isn't this easy? It is pretty easy. But it's also so invisible no one would know what I was talking about at a party in the valley. Systemd, what? Because we have a hard time understanding the invisible inner-workings of our computers. Because so few of us were involved back in the day when people used to build computers from scratch.

Many people throw up their hands in distress when you ask them what the difference is between RAM, a processor, and a hard disk. We don't all need to know these things, but if you expect to be involved in technology, shouldn't you?
