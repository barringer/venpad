### The best thing, or the next bext thing?

A lot of people don't understand this about me. I don't discard technologies because I'm always headed towards the next best thing. What I'm after is the best thing.

I want to be using quality technologies. So when I'm not present on the shitty centralized system you're a part of, it's not because I'm a cyber-hipster or some nonsense. It's because I think the service you use is shit. And I want to use quality technologies, not shitty ones.

So I'll go back in time and use a decentralized system, such as IRC, for a few months or a few years until the technology in question improves to point where I deem it to be quality. In the meantime, I will see how helpful I can be in developing these technologies.

I don't pretend to be a genius programmer. I am not. But I am good at judging whether or not a program is worth using.

Example 1. Mac OS X --> Linux. When I was 12 years old, I tried to install Linux on my machine. It was unstable, crappy, the interfaces were terrible. In 2012, I installed Linux on my computer. The interfaces were amazing, the code was beautiful, the systems almost never crash. The only question in Linux is this: how do I customize this amazing piece of technology? I left Mac OS X because it was turning into shit, and Linux had improved to a point where it was quality.

Example 2. Blogging --> Git, Cyphernet, unknown technology? RSS is broken. We all know this. If you're tech savvy, you don't use RSS. If you're an end user, you can't figure out how to use RSS. Either way, it's a lose. This means blogs are broken. So I'll go back to having a website, albiet a slightly more sophisticated Node.js generated website, until a better opportunity comes into being. By better, I mean quality.

Example 2. Peer to peer distributed social. I can't use a manipulative network. I don't want to be gaslit as I exchange information. I want to know when I send a message, it will not be filtered and parsed by who-the-fuck-knows. I want people to receive the message if they choose, and not receive it if they choose not to. This is how communication over the web should work. 

Quality is the opposite of shit. Take a look at this graphic.

Quality <-------------------------> Shit

Your operating system is headed towards the shit end of the stick
Your social network is headed towards the shit end of the stick
Your blog has been at the shit end of the stick for five years

So if you think I'm just doing this because I want the next best thing, you're wrong. I'm in it because I want the best thing.
