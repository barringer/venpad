All names are greylisted for anonymity

Sept 2013

A client suggested I change the name of Retrofit to Arch Your Box. In process.

A client suggested I use my own Git server to serve venpad, instead of Github. I want to reduce my reliance on Github as well, because there doesn't seem to be any advantages to using Github and I also worry they will shut down unexpectedly when/if they run out of money. Thinking of using cgit, as it's written in c, and is thus hardcore.

DONE. A client notified me my profile images were down on [deploy.evbogue.com](http://deploy.evbogue.com). Another client has been telling me about this for a few days now. Problem: switched from evbogue.com to venportman.com at my main website. Lost an image url in the process. Ducktaped: cp ven.jpg evbogue.jpg. Need to switch all urls to ven.jpg to fix the broken images. 

Also need to switch all names to Ven Portman across all projects.
